# Final-Comp-Sci-Project

Sadly the playlist feature only works when youre added as a developer in my spotify app, you can change the client id and secret to your own if you want to use them yourself

Create a spotify app here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

Also when you search large directories (or entire drives) it will seem like the program has crashed, please do not close it during this time as it (should) still be working, if it doesn't return a list after 5-10mins then it probably has crashed, or your drive that youre searching is really slow/really big

(If you want to use the program just go to 'Final-Comp-Sci-Project/Final Computer Science Project/bin/Release/net6.0-windows/Final Computer Science Project.exe' and run that)
